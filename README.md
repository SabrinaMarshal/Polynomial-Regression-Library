# Polynomial-Regression-Library
There is currently no library for implementing polynomial regression of any degree. Running the code for polynomial regression multiple times to calculate the dependent variable is a time consuming task. Converting this code into a library greatly decreases the time and effort spent on finding the result of the hypothesis.
Library- https://pypi.org/project/PolynomialRegression/0.0.1/
This library is for calculating polynomial regression. It will calculate the weights and result of any given hypothesis using either normal equation or gradient descent method. There is a function to try finding the best hypothesis by changing the degree of each term to find the hypothesis with the least error.
